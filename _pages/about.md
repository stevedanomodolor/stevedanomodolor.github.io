Hi, I'm Stevedan Ogochukwu Omodolor Omodia, a Robotic Engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Automatic Control and Robotics. My passion lies in designing and building autonomous systems that push the boundaries of technology. I have experience in developing robotics solutions, working across the full spectrum of mechanical design, software programming in C++ and Python, and robotic integration with frameworks like ROS. Whether it's controlling a robotic arm or developing autonomous drones, I thrive on solving complex problems and applying my skills to real-world applications.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a range of exciting projects, from upgrading PR2 robot arms at KU Leuven to developing grasping techniques with the Tiago robot at IRI. Currently, I’m working at Unmanned Life, where I focus on autonomous drone solutions. My responsibilities from a technical standpoint include software development for drone control, localization, and Behavior Tree-based mission planning. I also handle the mechanical design of drone components and lead the hardware integration, which involves incorporating Nvidia Jetson for onboard processing.

Beyond engineering, I have a passion for music. I’m a self-taught keyboard and bass player, and during my bachelor's, I had the privilege of serving as a music director for three years for my local church. This experience honed my leadership skills and fueled my creativity. Music, much like robotics, is an integral part of my life, offering both discipline and freedom in expression. My love for music also stems from the idea that with a foundation of theoretical knowledge, you can create beautiful and unique combinations. A great example of this is showcased in the following performance by pianist Cory Henry: [[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTwo2nT_APU)]."

Feel free to explore my work and projects. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a love for robotics, music, or problem-solving.

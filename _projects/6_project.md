The idea of visual servoing consist of controlling the motion of a robot using information obtained from a computer vision feedback system. The visual data can come from a camera placed directly on the the robotâ€™s end-effector(eye-in-hand configuration) or placed in a fixed position in the work space(fixed-camera configuration). The basic ideal of visual servoing consists of the minimization of an error value. The different visual-servoing techniques. differ with respect to the error function defined. In position-based image visual seroving(PBVS), the error function is specified based on position value in the robot task space. In Image-Based Visual servoing, the error function is defined in terms of image features. Although, IBVS is considered favorable compared to PBVS due to it low sensitivity to camera calibration errors, PBVS method was used. This is due to the limitation with respect to the control layer of the Tiago robot {% cite VisualServoing %}.
